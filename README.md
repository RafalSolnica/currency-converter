# Rafa≈Ç Solnica - Konwerter walut

made as a homework project during the YouCode course for a Frontend Developer carrier.
It was a great step in my education. I started to understand how JavaScript and CSS work.

## First time making a project where I combined:

- converting numbers by JavaScript
- CSS background item
- page's icon designed by me

## Demo

## https://mariahola.github.io/currency.converter/

### How it works?

##### The placeholder is made to insert the money amount in PLN.

##### Below you can choose the currency to convert, like: gold, bitcoin or Orlen stocks.

##### After taking these steps you will see converted amount.

### Project in a nutshell:

- HTML, BEM convention, Normalize.css, JavaScript, CSS
- minimalistic design
- super easy-to-use converter
